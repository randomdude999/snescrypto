# 65c816 cryptography routines

This is a set of cryptography-related algorithms implemented in 65c816 assembly, and thus are usable on e.g. the SNES.

The source files are using Asar syntax, but it should be fairly simple to port to other assemblers.

Currently includes AES in either CBC or CTR mode, and SHA-1. SHA-2 is a WIP.
